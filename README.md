## Bio
My name is Esteban Santos (him/they). I am currently a student of the SMU Coding Bootcamp program. Previously, I was a Maintenance Supervisor for various companies, including Pepsico, General Mills and Hormel Foods. I supervised and worked along side Maintenance Mechanics that troubleshot, fixed and completed preventative maintenance on manufacturing equipment. I learned about and worked on mixers, bottle fillers, blast freezers, and many many different types of conveying equipment. I enjoyed seeing how different products were made, from Fruit by the foot to Gatorade. Every experience was very valuable to me.

I studied at the University of Puerto Rico and obtained a degree in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on Power and Transmission Systems. I did not put it to use as I immediately went into the food manufacturing industry, as can be read about above. Since my foray in manufacturing, I grew to like the programming and logic side of equipment. I wanted to move closer to a career where I could use of the stored knowlegde from my college years. Now, I am studying and learning to be a programmer, specifically in web development. 

I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and am continuing my education as I progress through the SMU bootcamp. I am excited to learn more about the back end. One of my hobbies is Warhammer, which requires the building of armies using set units. Learning how to develop databases will allow me to create my own personal army builder that will help me in my hobby endevours.
